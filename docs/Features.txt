DTM Features
************

- INTRO -
DTM is separated in 2 distincts modules: the Engine and the GUI (graphical interface that uses what the Engine calculates).
The GUI needs the Engine in order to work, but the Engine doesn't need the GUI.

- ENGINE -
Its purpose is to determinate your threat and nearby allies/enemies' threat relative to nearby mobs.
DTM engine does it by maintaining threat list of mobs in your vicinity.
DTM parses the combat events in order to determinate most of the threat stuff.
If you are in a party/raid, DTM uses Blizzard AddOn network communication feature to get additionnal data about what's going on
from other party members that have also DTM installed on their client.
Most PC abilities are handled accurately by DTM, though some require you are in a party/raid whose members have DTM installed in order to be detected.
NPC (and most generally Bosses) abilities are also defined in DTM.

Features :
    - Multi-target threat meter, which makes difference between 2 mobs sharing the same name.
    - Determinates and maintain threat list of all entities around you.
    - Computes a fairly accurate threat value for each entity listed in a threat list.
    - Takes in account most player character abilities of every class.
    - Takes in account some NPC and Bosses abilities. New ones will be added each version.
    - Communicates with other DTM AddOns of the party/raid members to make sure no threat event is missed.
    - Independant threat computation. You have a fairly good idea of what one's threat is even if one hasn't DTM installed on one's client.
    - This mod is designed for English and French languages. German will work too, though the elements of DTM will be left in English for this locale.
    - Determinates who has aggro. Uses previous target in case the entity you are watching drops temporarily its current target.
    - Provides a simple to use API useable by other AddOns. The API is used itself in the GUI part of DTM.
    - DTM can detect special NPC yells/emotes in order to trigger threat events.
    - DTM takes your buffs/auras/talents/gear in account. It also computes them for your party/raid members.
    - The way the engine is designed make it easy to add new abilities, items, sets, talents etc. as new content is added in World of Warcraft!
    - Some others I've forgotten... :p

- GUI -
Its purpose is to provide a reasonable - nothing too fancy mind you - graphical interface with which you can configure most aspects of the engine and the
GUI itself and visualize a given entity's threat list. It uses a display similar to other threat meter AddOns, such as KTM or Omen:
a table with a header row and then bars of people on the threat list, moving, disapparearing etc. as threat data changes.
Currently the GUI allows you to watch 4 lists at once: your target's threat list, your focus' threat list, your overview list and your regain list.

Features :
    - Colored (damn that was so much work ! :)) animated (this one was also hot to code ^_^) bars dancing around in several types of list.
    - Filter entities on the fly: everybody / party-raid members only / party-raid non-pet members only.
    - Modifiable number of threat bars displayed simultaneously. Also allows you to be always visible in threat lists.
    - Two independant threat lists: target and focus ones. The way the GUI is designed allows to easily add more threat lists in the future.
    - An overview list, which shows all enemies that have you on their threat list.
    - A regain list, which shows when someone is going to pull aggro from you, or when you are going to pull aggro from the tank.
    - A little and as clear as I could do configuration panel, accessible from Blizzard's Interface options as a separate tab.
    - Customizable display through a skin system.
    - Some others I've forgotten... :p
