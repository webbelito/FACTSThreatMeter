DTM Performances and Incompatibilities
**************************************

1. Incompatibilities

- DTM scans through your party members' talents and store them in memory.
It is hard for AddOns to scan talents without getting in one another way.
DTM has been programmed to avoid getting in the way of other mods which could use the talent inspection feature.
But, basically, there's a slight risk of incompability between DTM and any AddOn which uses the inspect feature.

Beside that, DTM should run fine with any other AddOn. :)

2. Good stuff

- Alleviate WoW game servers AddOn communications, as DTM does not need to send threat update packets to the whole raid.

- DTM is able to work out threat values without the other players having the AddOn running,
  though it won't be able in some cases to compute some abilities accurately etc.

3. Stuff that isn't as good

- Probably quite expensive in processor usage, compared to other threat mods, though 2.4 combat log improvements have made
  the treatment MUCH faster, by removing the need of loooong strings parsing.
  Whatever I do to optimize the engine, keep in mind that estimating threat of 25 people is kinda longer than estimating your own threat only. ;)

- Do not support Spanish, Chinese, etc. languages. Perhaps *YOU* can help !
