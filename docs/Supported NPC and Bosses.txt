N.B: it's not because a npc/boss is not listed here that DTM will mess up with it:
not all bosses have special threat mechanics !

If you have feedback about [untested] NPC/bosses, such as "Yes it works" or "Well, the mob didn't behave the way you described it in your AddOn..."
I'd greatly appreciate. :)

[partial] can mean 2 things:

- The boss abilities are explained to DTM, but the system does not provide enough features yet to be able to describe them perfectly.
This often occurs if the mob does threat changes without shouting something or using some ability.

- OR I've got not enough info on the encounter to finish its description.
