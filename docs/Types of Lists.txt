Intro

As of 1.1.0, DTM features 3 display modes:

- The standard THREAT LIST display, of either your target or your focus.
- The OVERVIEW LIST, which shows your relative threat/percentage on all the NPCs that have you on their threat list.
- The REGAIN LIST, which works like the overview list but shows the margin you have before gaining OR losing aggro.

***********
Threat List
***********

The classic display, it shows the entities that a NPC doesn't like, sorted by their threat value.
The warning system is functionnal in this display mode, unlike the others.

*************
Overview List
*************

The overview list shows all NPCs that do not like you, along with your threat percentage relative to the threat of the guy who has the aggro of a given NPC in this list.
No warning is given in this display mode.
Good for healers and guys that do AoE spells.

***********
Regain List
***********

The regain list shows all NPCS that do not like you, in the same way as the overview list, but there are a few differences :
- the regain list does not tell your absolute threat and threat percentage.
Instead:
- if you have aggro of a given NPC, the bar will be full red and the row will tell you the threat
the 2nd most threatening person has to score before pulling the aggro from you and his/her name.
- If you do not have aggro, the row will tell you how much threat you have to score before pulling aggro.
