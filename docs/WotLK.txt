DTM @ WotLK ?
*************

The mod will continue to grow and adjust itself for the Xpac 2, even though
Blizzard stated they might implement a native ThreatMeter in the default interface.
If that were the case, DTM would drop its Engine portion and provide an enhanced GUI
for Blizzard's ThreatMeter, so DTM wouldn't be abandonned regardless whatever happens.

Thanks to modding sites I believe I have a pretty good chance to enter the Beta
and prepare the mod for the 3.0.1. If I were to enter it, I'd start to publish
Beta versions of DTM as well on Curse and WoWInterface.

EDIT: Native WoW threat meter is starting to get implemented.
This means following beta versions will have a highly altered Engine.

EDIT2: Got into Beta =)) Leveling up my chars while thinking about how to use the native threat value APIs the best way. :)
