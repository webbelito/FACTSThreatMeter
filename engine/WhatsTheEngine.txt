The engine is the part of DTM whose purpose is to make UnitThreat and other APIs defined by it work.

- The engine uses no graphics, buttons etc.
- The interaction of the user with it is just at most with command slashes and saved variables modifiable
with the configuration menu accessable through the GUI part of the mod. (but the GUI is NOT the engine, let's make it clear !)
- The engine has just a very basic non-visual frame with OnUpdate and OnEvent handlers on it.
