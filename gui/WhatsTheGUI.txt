The GUI is the part of DTM which presents menus, buttons etc. to the user to allow him to see visually data determined by the engine and
modify the addOn configuration, including how the engine is to work.

- The GUI uses graphics, buttons etc.
- The interaction of the user with it can be also done by command slashes, in addition to menu.
- The GUI needs the engine to display threat data. The engine doesn't need the GUI (but its options wouldn't be in that case modifiable).
